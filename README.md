Once that is done you can right click or long press on any message from someone that has set their timezone and select `Apps > Get Time`.

## Self Hosting

This bot requires the [Bun](https://bun.sh/) runtime.

2. Clone the repository.
3. Run `bun install` in the root of the cloned repository.
4. Create a file called `config.json` in the root directory and fill it out with the information from the bot you created in step 1.

config.json: 

```json
{
    "token": string,
    "clientId": string,
}
```

5. Run `bun deploy-commands`.
6. Run `bun start` to start the bot.
7. Add your bot's `clientId` to this url and go to it to invite the bot to your server: `https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=your client id here&permissions=274877908992&scope=bot`.
